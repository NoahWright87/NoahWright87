# Hi, I'm Noah
### Software developer, American Airman, loving husband, and special needs father
From self-taught teenager to college-educated veteran, creating software has been a huge part of my life.  I use code to fulfill my lifeline philosophy:

## Leave the place better than you found it
Everywhere I go, I try to have a positive impact.  It influences how I program, how I mentor junior developers, and how I raise my kids.  I can't change the world myself, but I can be certain to clean up more messes than I make.

### My Interests
- C# / .NET
- Unity game engine - I never gave up my childhood dream!
- SQL
- HTML / CSS / JS
- Security practices

### Current projects:
- 🤓 Learning in public via [my developer site](https:/noahwright.dev/) (for more soft skills) and [Let's Make a Program](https://letsmakeaprogram.com/) (for technical learning lessons).
- 👨‍🎓 Trudging through my Master's degree 
- 🤔 Improving my old *Spelling Quiz* program to handle all my school-age kids
